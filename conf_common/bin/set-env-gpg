# for gpg-agent and it's ssh-agent emulation to work everywhere, it needs to know the current
# startup tty to display the pinentry properly. also other programs need SSH_AUTH_SOCK, which
# used to be set here too, but i moved it to ~/.config/environment.d/ so that systemd programs
# and dmenu_package's programs could access it do. this solves an issue where virt-manager
# couldn't connect to remote kvm without access to my gpg-agent
